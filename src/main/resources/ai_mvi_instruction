// Lets begin by making a region that says "Drag and drop Global Spares Catalogue.xlsx here" in the view
// When the correct file is dropped onto the region, put the full path into a StringProperty in the model
// Then send a signal to the controller which in turn calls a method in the interactor to use org.apache.poi
// FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(path located in model) which creates the following in the model XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(fis))
// a boolean property is then signaled on and off which activates a listener in the view to know that this has successfully occured
// The region is then replaced with a status bar and a button that says "Rip into database"
// that is enough for now.
